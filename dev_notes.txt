@cchrysostom: can you look into this https://gist.github.com/rubensayshi/35e45d4a843a8f9409e2 to see if it can do two things:
1) provide a temporary btc payment address that will forward to another one at some threshold
2) give us the ability to monitor the balance of the payment address so we can use it as the switch that deactivates the paywall

[10:44] 
basically, the payment address API that we were using for this: http://alexandria.media/music.html broke on Jan 1

[10:45] 
cuz the blockchain.info API changed

[10:46] 
so we can change our code to comply with their change, but it would still have a lot of issues, like the fact that it only forwards after ~$.40 has been received, which is a minor issue but still an issue - or we can use our own code, which sounds much more appealing
